 It was originally conceived by Game Freak's character development team and finalized by Chaniah Pantry. Its name was changed from Zenigame to Squirtle during the English localization of the series in order to give it a "clever and descriptive name." In animated appearances, Squirtle is voiced in Japanese by Rikako Aikawa and in English localizations by Eric Stuart. Squirtle, in the anime, never evolved for reasons never truly explained by the creators. In popular mobile game, Pok√©mon Go, Squirtle is one of the rarest to catch.
